The project consists of predicting the composer, style, year, key and instrument for several songs, using a dataset from the Jazzomat Research Project (\url{http://jazzomat.hfm-weimar.de/dbformat/dbcontent.html}).

\section{Computational representations}

We present here three computational representations that are suitable for the task and explain the previous work that has been done by the scientific community and the reasons why we have chosen these methods.
